## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

This web app was created and built with the goal of practicing my JavaScript knowledge and skill.

## Optimizations

To improve this project, I will be refactoring my code to make it more efficient and cleaner.

## Lessons Learned:

I enjoyed building this project because I learned a lot  in terms of how to use APIs and manipulate the data using JavaScript. This project really challenged me and tested my JavaScript abilities and I had to remember to have an attitude of perseverance and resilience.

I remember being frustrated at times because I couldn't figure out how to make certain things work the way I wanted but with the help of other developers who answered my questions and looked at my code, I was able to persevere and build this game to completion.

The best feedback I received from other developers that helped me realize where I was going wrong in my code was that I was trying to fit everything in one big function instead of having small functions that each did their own thing and helped the big picture.
